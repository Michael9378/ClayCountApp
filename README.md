<h1>ClayCountApp</h1>
<h3>Explanation of Project</h3>
<p>For our senior project, we had to create an application to track scoring of a shotgun tournament, similar to golf scoring. The goal was to create a mobile application that can be used offline to keep score of the event, and automate addition of scores for shooters.</p>
<p>After running into troubles with the Android app, I decided to build the app on a web platform and then use web views for the Android and iOS apps.</p>
<h3>My Contributions</h3>
<p>I had no work on the iOS or Android apps, so I did not include them in these repos. However, I did the majority of the work in this repo. I wrote the schema for the database and setup the API. After setting up the API to connect to the database and writting the get, add, and a few update functions, another group member finished writing the update and delete calls. I wrote the entire logic in the web_app folder. There was some help from another group member on the styling, but the majority of the styles are my work. The help page was also written by other group members.</p>
<p>The project was rushed as we had to scrap our last app entirely and start anew. I initially wrote out logic to store ajax calls locally in case internet connection was lost, but ran out of time. I wish I could have gone back through and cleaned up the code, as well as style the app to look nicer.</p>
